=============================

Monlift is an application which allows users to offer and find car-pooling offers.
The lack of a car-pooling app and the high price offered by car-pooling websites in Quebec and Montreal are the reasons behind this new app.
Our goal is to build a very simple yet powerful app which will give drivers the ability to share their offers and passengers the ability to find what they are looking for quickly and easily.
And above all the application will be entirely free and community-controlled.
